## Overview
Hello! I am Victoria Chen and this is the repo for my personal website. Evidently, this project is still a WIP and I hope to have it fully up and running ASAP.

### Some details
* My website will mainly be done in HTML with some CSS or SASS to beautify things
* This is 100% a personal project done by me! 

For this project I will be learning: HTML, CSS/SASS, and website dev.

### Future plans
1. Get the CSS file working
2. Write up a basic static webpage with details about me
3. Beautify! Add transitions, format for better UX, etc.
